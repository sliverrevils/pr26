                    Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers
                    obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable
                    information online from children who are under the age of 13. Performstars does
                    not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from a
                    child under the age of 13 without obtaining verifiable consent from that child’s
                    parent or guardian (“Parental Consent”), except for the limited amount of
                    personally identifiable information we need to collect in order to obtain
                    Parental Consent (“Required Information”). Until Performstars has received
                    Parental Consent, Performstars will only use Required Information for the
                    purpose of obtaining Parental Consent. If You are a child under 13 years old,
                    please do not attempt to send any personal information about yourself to
                    Performstars before Performstars obtains Parental Consent, except for the
                    Required Information in the context of the Parental Consent process. If You
                    believe that a child under 13 years old has provided Performstars with personal
                    information (beyond the Required Information) without Performstars’s obtaining
                    Parental Consent, please contact Performstars at info@performstars.com.

                    or legal guardian of such children, and (2) You hereby provide consent in Your

                    from the Services within approximately 7-14 days from such request. However,

                    date You requested to Opt-Out of the Service, Your information may reappear in
                    Performstars’s databases and be used by the Service.

                    verify Your identity before fulfilling an Opt-Out request.

            <Post title="XII. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER, AS IS">
                <p>
                    To the full extent permissible by applicable law Performstars, Performstars’s
                    affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, providers, merchants,
                    sponsors, licensors, suppliers, or consultants, or the like, disclaim and
                    exclude all warranties for use of the property, or as to the accuracy,
                    reliability, or currency of any information, content, service, or merchandise
                    provided through the property. furthermore, Performstars does not warrant that
                    the property will be uninterrupted or error free, that defects will be
                    corrected, or that the property or the server that makes it available are free
                    of viruses or other harmful components; nor does Performstars make any warranty
                    against interference with your enjoyment of any experience or of the property,
                    or against infringement or of title. each property is provided on an “as is,”
                    “as available” basis and Performstars specifically disclaim warranties of any
                    kind either expressed or implied, including but not limited to warranties of
                    title or implied warranties of merchantability, noninfringement, or fitness for
                    a particular purpose. none of the oral advice or written information given by
                    Performstars, Performstars’s affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents,
                    providers, merchants, sponsors, licensors, suppliers, contractors, or the like,
                    shall create a warranty. if you are dissatisfied with Performstars’s service or
                    its content (including these terms and conditions), your sole and exclusive
                    remedy is to discontinue using Performstars’s service.

            <Post title="XIII. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY">
                <p>
                    Neither Performstars nor any of its officers, directors, employees or other
                    representatives will be liable for damages of any kind arising out of or in
                    connection with the use of the property or any information contained herein,
                    even if advised of the possibility thereof. Performstars assumes no
                    responsibility, and shall not be liable for any damages to, or viruses that may
                    infect your computer equipment, mobile devices, or other property on account of
                    your access to, use of, or browsing in the service or your downloading of any
                    materials, data, text, images, video, or audio from the service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You further agree that Performstars’s total liability from or related to your
                    use of and access to the property, whether the form of action or claim is in
                    contract, warranty, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, is limited
                    to the aggregate twelve (12) months of fees paid to Performstars by you in the
                    twelve (12) months immediate preceding the event that lead to your claim. except
                    as expressly provided hereunder, under no circumstances shall Performstars or
                    any other party involved in creating, producing, or distributing the property be
                    liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages,
                    including loss of profits, good will, use, data or other intangible losses (even
                    if Performstars have been advised of the possibility of such damages) that
                    result from (i) the use of or inability to use the property, (ii) unauthorized
                    access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iii) statements or
                    conduct of any third party on the property; or (iv) any other matter relating to
                    the property. you hereby acknowledge that this paragraph shall apply to all
                    content and services available through the property. because some states do not
                    allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental
                    damages, in such states liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by
                    law.

                <p>
                    These Terms and Conditions are effective until terminated by either party. If
                    any user is found violating the provisions of these Terms and Conditions,
                    Performstars may terminate these Terms and Conditions effective immediately upon

                    Conditions, You must cease Your use of the Service. Subject to applicable law,
                    Performstars reserves the right to suspend or deny, in Performstars’s sole
                    discretion, Your access to all or any portion of the Service with or without
                    notice. You agree that any termination of Your access to the Service may be
                    effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Performstars may

                    files in Your account, bar any further access to such files or the Service and
                    disable Your password. Further, You agree that Performstars shall not be liable
                    to You or any third party for any termination of Your access to the Service.
                    Notwithstanding termination or suspension, You will still be liable for the
                    payment of any amounts due or other obligations incurred before termination or
                    suspension, whether Your use of the Service is terminated or suspended by You or

                    before You decide to terminate Your account and/or the Services. You agree that
                    Performstars is not and shall not be responsible for restoration of Your account

                    conditions that may apply when You use affiliate services, third party content
                    or third party software. Performstars’s failure to exercise or enforce any right
                    or provisions of the Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such
                    right or provisions. If any provision of the Terms and Conditions is found by a
                    court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree
                    that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as
                    reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms and Conditions
                    shall remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute
                    or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related
                    to use of the Service, the Content or the Terms and Conditions must be filed
