                <p>
                    Users based in the European Union have the following legal rights in respect of
                    their information:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The right to require PerformStars to confirm whether or not their information is
                    being processed, the purpose of any such processing, the recipients of any
                    information that has been disclosed, the period for which their information is
                    to be stored and whether any automated decision-making processes are used in
                    relation to their information;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The right to require PerformStars to rectify inaccurate information without
                    undue delay;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The right to request the erasure of their information. Subject to certain
                    conditions, PerformStars may be required to erase the information in response to
                    such request where:
                </p>
                <p>
                    the information is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it
                    was collected, such as where a user chooses to terminate his or her use of the
                    Service;
                </p>
                <p>
                    where the processing of the information is based on the user’s consent (and the
                    other circumstances described in the ‘Legal Basis for Processing Your
                    information’ and ‘How We May Share Your information’ sections above no longer
                    apply), if the user withdraws his or her consent; or
                </p>
                <p>
                    the user objects to the processing of his or her information and there are no
                    overriding legitimate grounds for the processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where PerformStars has disclosed the information of a European Union user to a
                    third party and the user requests the erasure or rectification of the data,
                    PerformStars will take all reasonable steps to inform the third party of such
                    request.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The right to restrict PerformStars from processing their information in certain
                    circumstances, such as where the accuracy of that information is disputed or an
                    objection has been raised (see below). In such circumstances, PerformStars will
                    only process that information with the express consent of the user, or for the
                    establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the
                    rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public
                    interest;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The right to receive their information from PerformStars in a structured,
                    commonly used and machine-readable format;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The right to object to the processing of their information by PerformStars
                    where:
                </p>
                <p>
                    PerformStars has relied on the ‘legitimate interest’ basis for processing that
                    information, in which case we will immediately stop processing the user’s
                    information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds which override the
                    interests, rights and freedoms of the user; or
                </p>
                <p>
                    the information is used for direct marketing purposes, in which case we will
                    immediately stop processing the user’s information for such purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The right to lodge a complaint with the data protection supervisory authority of
                    the EU member state where the user resides.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The above legal rights are subject to various conditions and exceptions
                    including where the data is used for statistical or scientific research purposes
                    and the exercise of the right would prevent such purposes from being attained or
                    would seriously impair their attainment.
